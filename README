This is an SNMP spider that will take a list of routers, and discover
all networks and routers reachable from them.

It generates a dot file (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language), which
can then be used by other programs to generate graphs displaying routes,
routers and connected networks.

Usage is:

  ./spiderPub comunity alternatecomunity centralRouterIP routerIP routerIP routerIP ...

The centralRouterIP replaces any routes to "0.0.0.0/0", so this really works better with
a star topology. You don't need to pass the IP to all routers, but you need to pass the
IP of any router that cannot be discovered from the others (like routers whose connection
go through a third party).

It will always try the first comunity, and fall back to the alternate if the first fails.

As you can see, things are very bare bones, but it did the job I needed it to, and a
friend wanted to use it, so I'm making it public. :-)
